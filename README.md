# Poker: Texas Hold'em
This project encompasses the OSU FEH I capstone project, reflecting the card game **Poker: Texas Hold'em**.

How to play:
The goal of the game is to have a hand that is valued better than your opponents and these valuations will be explained later. To start, each player is given 2 cards. An initial buy-in is taken, costing 100 points. From there, each player has the choice to either raise the pot or pass If the pot is raised, the player must either pass, in which they don't play for the rest of the round, or can match and put in the same amounts of tokens that were raised by the other player. After this, the next card is flipped and the process is repeated until 5 cards are laid out. Once the final round of bidding is complete, players reveal their hands, and the player that had the higher rank hand wins. The winning player then receives the points in the pot. Games are played until 1 player runs out of points or both players choose to stop.
